* Generate unique avatars (like those found on Github or Slack).
* Generate other documents and graphics with a persistent look (such as banners, posters & invoices).
* Animate SVG-files.
* Visualisation of large data-sets in vector format.
* Automatic layout of any quadratic entity, such as a poster.
* Store repetitive SVGs as code instead of SVG-files. (Saves space, and enables easy manipulation)
* Serve graphics without storage.
